The <code>get_loader</code> function loads the dataset, resizing images to match the current resolution and normalizing them to [-1, 1]. Batch sizes dynamically adjust for different resolutions, ensuring efficient memory usage. Data is fed into a PyTorch DataLoader for training.\n",

For the discriminator, real images are compared to generated ones using the Wasserstein loss with gradient penalty, ensuring stable learning. For the generator, the loss measures its ability to create realistic images that fool the discriminator. Alpha blending is used to smoothly transition between resolutions by combining outputs of lower and higher resolution blocks.\n",

It begins at the lowest resolution (4x4) and progressively grows to higher resolutions by increasing the step size after training each stage for a predefined number of epochs. During training, visual samples and model checkpoints are saved periodically for monitoring and resuming progress.\n",

Over five epochs, the alpha value transitions smoothly from 0 to 1, signaling a successful blending of lower and higher-resolution features. The generator and discriminator losses fluctuate, as is typical in GAN training, but generally trend toward stabilization. Early epochs show the discriminator dominating, with higher generator losses indicating difficulty in producing convincing samples. By later epochs, the generator recovers, evidenced by losses closer to zero and occasional negative values, suggesting improved sample quality. \n",

The losses of both the discriminator and generator display notable fluctuations, a hallmark of adversarial training. Initially, the generator struggles, as seen in negative loss values, but recovers in later epochs with positive losses, indicating better-quality outputs. The discriminator's loss varies significantly, suggesting a dynamic balance in the adversarial process. Each epoch takes approximately 75 minutes due to the increased complexity of handling larger images.\n",

For what we have, the training process significantly slows down due to the increased complexity of handling larger images. In the first epoch, the training takes over five hours, with the discriminator showing a negative loss value (-0.567) and the generator struggling even more with a loss of -1.21. This suggests that the generator's output is still far from ideal, and the discriminator is pushing it harder. In the second epoch, the losses start to improve, with the generator showing a sharp increase in its loss (+3.3), indicating that it is starting to generate more convincing images.\n",

    "    <p>\n",
    "        In conclusion, this project serves more as a research exercise and proof of concept rather than yielding optimal results at this stage. While the model demonstrated gradual progress, the computational resources available were limiting, especially in terms of training at higher resolutions. Utilizing more powerful hardware, such as GPUs in the VR lab, could allow for longer training times, more epochs, and improved results at higher image resolutions, which is essential for generating more realistic outputs.\n",
    "    </p>\n",
    "    <p>\n",
    "        Throughout the training, the discriminator and generator exhibited a cyclical pattern of learning. As expected, when the discriminator became more powerful, the generator had to catch up, and vice versa. Initially, the generator struggled to produce convincing images, but as the training progressed, it started to generate more plausible outputs. The fade-in mechanism, which helps smooth the transition between different image resolutions, also played a crucial role in stabilizing the training process.\n",
    "    </p>\n",
    "    <p>\n",
    "        The reason we stopped the epochs early was because we ran out of time to submit as the higher the resolution the higher the computation power due to the amount of data being passed into the model and also the amount of layers that we have already built upon.\n",
    "    </p>\n",
    "    <p>\n",
    "        Despite the challenges, the project shows considerable promise, and with continued tuning and access to more computational resources, more consistent and high-quality image generation is achievable. Future experiments could explore additional architectural tweaks, data augmentation strategies, and extended training epochs for improved outcomes.\n",
