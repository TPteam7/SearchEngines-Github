Sorry. Go back to sleep.
There’s no ghost, Murph.
Maybe Grandpa’s a little too close
to being one himself. Back to
sleep.
Back to sleep, Murph.

What’d you do to my lander?
Hey
Murph, you know that’s not
scientific.
Start looking after our stuff.
Fine. Murph, you wanna talk
science, don’t just tell me you’re
scared of some ghost - record the
facts, analyze, present your
conclusions.
Dust storm?
Blight?
Shoulda planted corn like the rest
of us.
What’s that supposed to mean?
Start minding your business.
Okay, gimme second.
She didn’t do anything. We lost a
tire is all.
Grab the spare.
Okay, patch kit.
Figure it out. I’m not always going
to be here to help you.
We didn’t.
Murphy’s Law doesn’t mean bad stuff
will happen. It means ’whatever can
happen, will happen’. And that
sounded just fine to us.

What?
Come on!
Get in!
Indian air force surveillance
drone. Solar cells could power an
entire farm.
Take the wheel!
Faster, Tom. I’m losing it.
Almost got it. Don’t stop.
Tom!
Guess that answers the ’if I told
you to drive off a cliff’ scenario.
No, we didn’t.
Want to give it a whirl?

Let’s set her down next to the
river.
Delhi mission control went down
same as ours, ten years ago.
Sun finally cooked its brain. Or it
came down looking for something.
Some kind of signal. Who knows?
Give it something socially
responsible to do, like drive a
combine.
This thing has to adapt, just like
the rest of us.

How’s this work? You guys come
with?
Why? What?
Am I gonna be mad?
Relax, I got this.
Actually, sir, it’s a surveillance
drone. With outstanding solar
cells.

What about college?
I’m still paying taxes - where’s
that go? There’s no more armies.
You’re ruling him out for college
now? He’s fifteen.
What’re you? About a
thirty-six-inch waist?
Thirty-inch inseam?
You’re telling me you need two
numbers to measure your own ass,
but just one to measure my son’s
future?

And an engineer.
Are we done, sir?
Yeah, it’s one of my old textbooks,
she likes the pictures.
Corrected?
You don’t believe we went to the
moon?
’Useless machines’?
One of those useless machines they
used to make was called an MRI. And
if we had any of them left, the
doctors might have been able to
find the cyst in my wife’s brain
before she died, rather than
afterwards. Then she could be
sitting here listening to this,
which’d be good, cos she was always
the calmer one ...

Sure. Well, there’s a ball game
tomorrow night, and Murph’s going
through a bit of a baseball phase.
There’ll be candy and soda.
I think I’ll take her to that.
I, uh ... got you suspended.
Sorry.
Cooper.
Power the controllers down for a
couple minutes.
Why?
Morse?
Murph, I know what Morse code is. I
just don’t think your bookshelf’s
trying to talk to you.
Had to reset every compass clock
and GPS to offset for the anomaly.
No idea. If the house was built on
magnetic ore, we’d’ve seen this the
first time we switched on a
tractor.
We’ve forgotten who we are, Donald.
Explorers, pioneers. Not
caretakers.
We used to look up and wonder at
our place in the stars. Now we just
look down and worry about our place
in the dirt.
Well, in my day people were too
busy fighting over food for
baseball, so consider this
progress.
The school says you’re gonna follow
in my footsteps. I think that’s
great.
What’s important is how you feel
about it, Tom.
Come on, guys.
Mask up, guys.
Did you both shut your windows?
Grab your pillow, sleep in with
Tom.
It’s not a ghost ...
It’s gravity.

I got something.
- it’s numbers ... number pairs...
Coordinates.
Grandpa’s back in two hours.

That’s why I can’t take you.
Murph?
Nothing.
Murph, just wait here for Grandpa.
Tell him I’ll call him on the
radio.
JESUS!
Murph, what are you doing?!
Fair enough. Make yourself
useful...

Murph. Murph.
Murph wakes.
I think this is as far as we get.
Murph glances out at the fence. Closes her eyes again.
I like your spirit, young lady.
Nothing.
Don’t shoot! My child is in the
car! I’m unarmed! My daughter is. Murph
Where’s my daughter?
WHERE’S MY DAUGHTER?!
You might think you’re still in the
Marines, but the Marines don’t
exist anymore, pal. I’ve got grunts
like you mowing my grass ...
But you don’t look like a lawnmower
to me ... you, I’m gonna turn into
an overqualified vacuum cleaner 
You’re taking a risk using
ex-military for security. They’re
old, their control units are
unpredictable ...

Who are you?
I knew a Dr Brand once. But he was
a professor
And nowhere near as cute.
Dr Brand, I have no idea what this
mess is. I’m scared for my little
girl and I want her by my side.
Then I’ll tell you anything you
want to know. Okay?
It’s pretty clear you don’t want
visitors - why not let us back up
from your fence and be on our way?

Sure it is. I don’t know anything
about you or this place.
Professor Brand?
Stumbled across it. Looking for
salvage and I saw the fence 
It’s hard to explain, but we
learned these coordinates from an
anomaly ...
I don’t want to term it
’supernatural’ ... but ...
After that last storm, it was a
pattern ... in dust.
Look, I’m happy you’re excited
about gravity, but if you want more
answers from us I’m gonna need
assurances.
That we’re getting out of here ...
and not in the trunk of some car.

No. No, I don’t.
NASA?
I heard you got shut down for
refusing to drop bombs from the
stratosphere onto starving people.
Why secret?
But we’re growing more than ever.
We’ll find a way, we always have.
Not just ours, but it is our home.
Tell me this is where you explain
how you’re going to save the world.

Rangers.
What happened to the other
vehicles?
Sounds cheerful.
He had to die in the first place.
You sent people out there looking
for a new home.
There’s no planet in our solar
system that can support life ...
and it’d take them a thousand years
to reach the nearest star - that
doesn’t even qualify as futile.
Where did you send them, Professor?
I barely left the stratosphere.
Without ever knowing. An hour ago,
you didn’t even know I was still
alive. And you were going anyway.
Who’s ’they’?
How long would I be gone?
I’ve got my kids, Professor.
Who’s ’they’?
Over the Straights - my crash something tripped my fly-by wire.
A wormhole?
Where does it lead?
A wormhole isn’t a naturally
occurring phenomenon.
’They’.
You sent probes into it?

The Lazarus missions.
And if their world didn’t show
promise?
Because you don’t have resources to
visit all twelve.
One? Kind of a long shot.
So if we find a new home, what
then?
This whole facility ... it’s a
vehicle? A space station?
How does it get off the Earth?
But you haven’t solved it, yet.
How could you raise them?
We just give up on the people here?
Where have you got to?
Almost? You’re asking me to hang
everything on an ’almost’?
All those years of training - you
never told me.
Murph?
I’m not gonna lie to you, Donald heading out there is what I feel
born to do and it excites me. That
doesn’t make it wrong.

Well, the foundation’s solid.
We farmers sit here every year when
the rains fail and say ’next year’.
Next year ain’t gonna save us. Nor
the one after. This world’s a
treasure, Donald. But she’s been
telling us to leave for a while
now.
Mankind was born on Earth. It was
never meant to die here.
I will.
You have to talk to me.
Nothing.
I have to fix this before I go.

After you kids came along, your
mother said something I didn’t
really understand - she said, ’I
look at the babies and I see myself
as they’ll remember me.’ She said,
’It’s as if we don’t exist anymore,
like we’re ghosts, like now we’re
just there to be memories for our
kids.’ Now I realize - once we’re
parents, we’re just the ghosts of
our childrens’ futures.
That’s right. I can’t be your ghost
right now - I need to exist.
Because they chose me. They chose
me, Murph. You saw it.
Oh, Murph.
It’s okay, it’s okay ...
Murph, a father looks in his
child’s eyes and thinks - maybe
it’s them ... maybe my child will
save the world. And everyone, once
a child, wants to look into their
own dad’s eyes and know he saw how
they saved some little corner of
their world. But, usually, by then,
the father is gone.
No. I’m coming back.
One for you. One for me.
When I’m in hyper-sleep, or travel
near the speed of light, or near a
black hole, time will change for
me. It’ll run more slowly. When I
get back we’ll compare.
Yup. By the time I get back we
might even be the same age. You and
me. Imagine that ...

Don’t make me leave like this.
Nothing.
Please. I have to go now.
I love you, Murph. Forever. And I’m
coming back.
Fine. It was fine.
I love you, Tom.
Look after our place, you hear?
I’ll make sure they bring it back
for you.
Mind my kids for me, Donald.

A massive, sarcastic robot. What a
great idea.

Probably help.
What’s your humor setting, Tars?
Take it to seventy-five, please.
We’ll get back.
It’s hard. Leaving everything. My
kids ... your father ...
We should learn to talk.

Maybe you don’t need to be that
honest.
Tars, what’s your honesty
parameter?
Ninety? What kind of robot are you?
Ninety percent honesty it is, then.
Talking fine. Ready to spin?
Keep an eye on my family, sir.
Specially Murph. She’s a smart one.
So alone.
I meant them. Look at that perfect
planet. We’re not gonna find
another one like her.
Who’s Edmunds?
None of them had family?
Tell me about Dr Mann.
Brand replaces the screen image for a grainy, white orb.
Nature can’t be evil?
Just what we bring with us, then.
Even me?

Hey, I’ve been waiting a long time
to be up here
Show me the trajectory again.
Tars? Was Dr Brand
Were Dr Brand and Edmunds ...
close?
Is that ninety percent, or ten
percent ’wouldn’t know’?
So I gather ...

The Earth looks amazing from here.This
should get to you okay ...
Professor Brand said he’d make sure
of it. Guess I’ll say good night.
You good, Rom?
We’re explorers, Rom, on the
greatest ocean of all.
A lot of the finest solo yachtsmen
couldn’t swim. They knew if they
went overboard that was it, anyway.
This is no different.
From the relay probe?
Like swinging a periscope around?
So we’ve got a pretty good idea
what we’re gonna find on the other
side?
Strap in - I’m killing the spin ...
Say it, don’t spray it, Rom.
It’s a sphere.
I’m not thanking anyone till we get
through it in one piece.
Any trick to this?
But the others made it, right?
Thanks for the confidence boost.
Everybody ready to say goodbye to
our solar system?
Gargantua?
Look, I can swing around that
neutron star to decelerate.
How bad?
Jesus.
That’s easy for you to say - you
don’t have anyone back on Earth
waiting for you, do you?
How far off the planet do we have
to stay to be out of the time
shift?
So we track a wider orbit of
Gargantua, parallel with Miller’s
planet but a little further out ...
take a Ranger down, grab Miller and
her samples, debrief and analyze
back here
No time for monkey business down
there - Tars, you’d better wait up
here. Who else?
Okay. Tars, factor an orbit of
Gargantua - minimal thrusting conserve fuel - but stay in range.
Ready?
Don’t say much, do you?

Romilly, you reading these forces?
No way to get anything from it?
We’re gonna use the Ranger’s
aerodynamics to save the fuel.
Wanna get in fast, don’t we?
Hands where I can see them, Case!
Only time I ever went down was a
machine easing at the wrong moment
Can get you killed, same as
reckless.
I got this.

No! No, I need to feel the air ...
Do we have a fix on the beacon?
Gotta shave more speed. I’ll try
and spiral down on it.
Wait for it ...
Fire!
No. But it was very efficient.
What’re you waiting for? Go!
Come on ...
Those aren’t mountains ...
They’re waves!
Brand, get back here!
Dammit! Brand, get back here!
You don’t have time!
Case is back at Doyle.
Get back here! Now!
Get up, Brand!
Doyle! Come on! Case has her!
Come on, come on ...
Shut the hatch!

Power down! Power down! We have to
ride it out!
We are not prepared for this!
And I told you to get your ass back
here! Difference is, only one of us
was thinking about the mission 
Tell that to Doyle.
How long to drain, Case?
The stuff of life, huh? What’s this
gonna cost us, Brand?
What happened to Miller?
How could the wreckage still be
together after all these years?
We’re not prepared for this, Brand.
You’re a bunch of eggheads without
the survival skills of a boy-scout
troop.
Not far enough. And we’re stuck
here till there won’t be anyone
left on Earth to save.
Don’t you have some clever way we
jump into a black hole and get back
the years?

Don’t just shake your head at me -!
The beings who led us here ... they
communicate through gravity ...
Could they be talking to us from
the future?
Well, if they can.
My daughter was ten. I couldn’t
explain Einstein’s theories before
I left.
No. I wasn’t much of a parent, but
I understood the most important
thing - let your kids feel safe.
Which rules out telling a
ten-year-old that the world’s
ending.
How long for the engines?
We don’t have it!
Helmets on!
Blow our cabin oxygen through the
main thrusters.

How many years?
I know.
Just start at the beginning.
Murph?
Tars kept the Endurance right where
we needed her, but it took years
longer than we anticipated ...
We don’t have the fuel to visit
both prospects. We have to choose.
As does Dr Mann’s.
Why?

You once referred to Dr Mann as the
’best of us’.
And he’s there on the ground
sending an unambiguous message that
we should go to that planet.
If we’re going to vote, there’s
something you need to know. Brand?
He has a right to know.
She’s in love with Wolf Edmunds.
You’re a scientist, Brand.
It means social utility - child
rearing, social bonding.
Tars, set the course for Dr Mann.
Brand, I’m sorry.
This wasn’t a personal decision for
me.
Lazarus.
With our situation, there’s not
much hope of any other rescue.
How far have you explored?
He never even hoped to get people
off the Earth.
More what?!
Is that true?
If we could look beyond the horizon
Bullshit.
No. That’s being made by the people
of Earth who’ll die because, in his
arrogance, he declared their case
hopeless.
Let me go home.
They can stay. I’ll sleep most of
the journey.

What?
Gentle?
What happens to it after it
crosses?
You’d do this for us?
Your cue light’s broken.
Ranger’s almost ready. Case is on
his way back down with another
load.
We need to pick out a site. You
don’t wanna move the module once we
land it.
Will conditions hold?
Good to go.
A little caution, Case?
If this excursion is about trying
to change my mind, let’s turn
around right now.
Frankly, no.
That’s why I’m going home, hopeless
or not.
Professor Brand would disagree.

What are you doing?!
They can’t stay here, Tom!
Why?!
You faked all the data?
Is there even a surface?
You fucking coward.

Mann! Don’t - you’ll kill us both.
FIFTY-FIFTY YOU KILL YOUR SELF!
BRAND! BRAND!
NO AIR - AMMONIA.
MANN - WAS - MANN BRAND
Dr Mann did this?!
What happened to caution?
Brand, I’m sorry. We should’ve
followed your instincts. Mann lied
about this place.

Do you have a fix on the Ranger?
If he takes control of the ship
we’re dead.
He is marooning us.
Dr Mann? Dr Mann, please respond.

The autopilot does.
Nice. What’s your trust setting?
Dr Mann?
Dr Mann, if you attempt docking.
Dr Mann, do not attempt docking. Dr
Mann?
Static.
Is he locked on?
Dr Mann! Dr Mann! Do not, repeat do
not attempt to open the hatch! If
you.
What happens if he blows the hatch?
Pull us back!
Case hits the retro-thrusters.
Just analyze the Endurance’s spin.

Docking.
Get ready to match it on the
retro-thrusters.
No... It’s necessary.
Case, you ready?
If I black out, take the stick Tars, get ready to engage the
docking mechanism - Brand, hold
tight.
Come on, Tars ... come on ...
Gen-- gentle, Case.
Get ready to pull us up The spin is slowing to almost nothing -

Come on. You can do it ...
Right? And for our next trick ...
Take her.
No! Let her slide as long as we can.
Give it to me.
I’ve heard that one, Tars - just
give it to me straight.
The navigation mainframe’s
destroyed and we don’t have enough
life support to make it back to
Earth. But we might scrape to
Edmunds’ planet.
Not enough. But I’ve got a plan let Gargantua suck us right to her
horizon - then a powered slingshot
around to launch us at Edmunds.
That’s what I’m here for. I’ll take
us just inside the critical orbit.
Neither of us can afford to worry
about relativity right now.

Once we’ve gathered enough speed
around Gargantua - we use the
lander 1 Ranger 2 as
rocket-boosters to push us out of
the black hole’s gravity.
So we’ll control manually. When
Lander 1’s spent, Tars will detach.

We have to shed mass if we’re gonna
escape that gravity.
He’s a robot, Amelia - I don’t have
to ask him to do anything.
Sorry, you broke up a little there.
Ready.
Fire.
That little maneuver cost us
fifty-one years ...!
Hey, Case? Nice reckless flying.
Newton’s third law - you have to
leave something behind.

Hey, we agreed - ninety percent.
Detach.
Tars? Are you there?
Murph? Murph?
MURPH! MURPH!
Don’t leave your kids. You goddamn
fool.
S ... T ...
A ... Y ...
Stay, you idiot! Tell him, Murph!
Stay.
Don’t let
him leave ...!
Murph, don’t let me leave.
You survived.
Who’s ’They’? And why would they
help us?

It isn’t working!
Gravity. To send a message ...
And you have the quantum data, now
I can do it.
Not just any child.

Then figure something out!
Everybody on Earth is going to die!
We brought ourselves here.
Tars, feed me the coordinates of
Don’t you see, Tars? I brought
myself here. We’re here to
communicate with the
three-dimensional world. We’re the
bridge ...
I thought they chose me - they
never chose me - they chose Murph.
To save the world!

’They’ have access to infinite
time, infinite space.
But no way to find what they need but I can find Murph and find a way
to tell her - like I found this
moment.
Love, Tars... Love - just like Brand
said - that’s how we find things
here.
The watch. That’s it. She’ll come
back for it TARS
How do you know?
Because I gave it to her. We use
the second hand. Translate the data
into Morse and feed it to me Tars starts to transmit.

She will. She will ... I feel it.
Did it work?
Why?
Don’t you get it, yet, Tars? ’They’
aren’t ’beings’ ... they’re us ...
trying to help ... just like I
tried to help Murph ...
Not yet ... but one day. Not you
and me but people, people who’ve
evolved beyond the four dimensions
we know ...
What happens now?
Where am I?
Nice of you to name the place after
me.

What?
Is she ...
still alive?
Yes, it is ...
She did, huh?

Is that ...?
Please.
Honesty. New level setting.
Ninety-five percent.
Yes. Humor, seventy-five percent.
Wait.
Sixty percent.
Is she?

The family?
Murph.
You told them I like farming.
Murph, it was me. I was your ghost.
I’m here now. I’m here for you,
Murph.
Where?
