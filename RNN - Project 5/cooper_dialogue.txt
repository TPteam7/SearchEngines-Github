Sorry. Go back to sleep.
There’s no ghost, Murph.
Maybe Grandpa’s a little too close
to being one himself. Back to
sleep.
Back to sleep, Murph.
Murph shuffles back out the door. Cooper moves to the
window. DAWN breaks over an ENDLESS SEA OF CORN ...

What’d you do to my lander?
Hey MURPH
I looked it up, it’s called a
poltergeist.
Murph, you know that’s not
scientific.
Start looking after our stuff.
Donald looks at Cooper, admonishing. Cooper shrugs.
Fine. Murph, you wanna talk
science, don’t just tell me you’re
scared of some ghost - record the
facts, analyze, present your
conclusions.
Dust storm?
Blight?
Shoulda planted corn like the rest
of us.
What’s that supposed to mean?
Start minding your business.
Okay, gimme second Murph wrestles the long gear stick into second. Cooper sips.
Now third Murph struggles to find third - GRIND.
She didn’t do anything. We lost a
tire is all.
Grab the spare.
Okay, patch kit.
Figure it out. I’m not always going
to be here to help you.
Tom moves to the back of the truck. Murph is there.
We didn’t.
Murphy’s Law doesn’t mean bad stuff
will happen. It means ’whatever can
happen, will happen’. And that
sounded just fine to us.

Murph frowns, hearing something ...
What?
Then Cooper hears it, too. A LOW RUMBLE. Cooper GRABS Murph
as a DRONE SOARS low overhead COOPER
Come on!
Cooper jumps into the truck - he pulls out a laptop and
antenna hands them to Murph - shouts at Tom COOPER
Get in!
Indian air force surveillance
drone. Solar cells could power an
entire farm.
Take the wheel Tom takes the wheel - Cooper hands Murph the antenna.
Keep it pointed right at it Cooper works the laptop - the screen fills with Hindi.
Faster, Tom. I’m losing it.
Tom WEAVES through the corn - they round a corner, almost
Almost got it. Don’t stop.
In front of them, the drone plummets from view into the next
valley - the path ahead leads to a three-hundred-foot drop.
Tom!
Tom locks up the brakes. Cooper looks at him - he shrugs.
Guess that answers the ’if I told
you to drive off a cliff’ scenario.
Murph is still pointing the antenna.
No, we didn’t.
The DRONE SOARS BACK OVER THEM - Cooper is moving his
fingers across the track pad, PILOTING THE DRONE.
As the kids watch, Cooper sends the drone soaring over them,
banking above the valley. Cooper crouches next to Murph.
Want to give it a whirl?
Murph, guided by Cooper, moves her fingers across the track
pad - the massive drone BANKS in response. Murph is in
heaven.

Let’s set her down next to the
river.
Delhi mission control went down
same as ours, ten years ago.
Sun finally cooked its brain. Or it
came down looking for something.
Some kind of signal. Who knows?
Cooper finds an access hatch. Pries it open. Examines the
black-box brain of the machine.
Give it something socially
responsible to do, like drive a
combine.
This thing has to adapt, just like
the rest of us.

How’s this work? You guys come
with?
Why? What?
Am I gonna be mad?
Relax, I got this.
Murph pulls out a notebook. Starts drawing a BARCODE.
Actually, sir, it’s a surveillance
drone. With outstanding solar
cells.

Cooper nods at Murph’s teacher, Ms Hanley, thirties,
attractive.
What about college?
I’m still paying taxes - where’s
that go? There’s no more armies.
You’re ruling him out for college
now? He’s fifteen.
What’re you? About a
thirty-six-inch waist?
Thirty-inch inseam?
You’re telling me you need two
numbers to measure your own ass,
but just one to measure my son’s
future?
Ms Hanley stifles a laugh. The Principal shoots her a look.

And an engineer.
Are we done, sir?
Yeah, it’s one of my old textbooks,
she likes the pictures.
Corrected?
You don’t believe we went to the
moon?
’Useless machines’?
One of those useless machines they
used to make was called an MRI. And
if we had any of them left, the
doctors might have been able to
find the cyst in my wife’s brain
before she died, rather than
afterwards. Then she could be
sitting here listening to this,
which’d be good, cos she was always
the calmer one ...
Ms Hanley looks at Cooper, embarrassed. Then MS HANLEY
I’m sorry about your wife, Mr
Cooper. But Murph got into a fist
fight with several of her
classmates over this Apollo
nonsense and we thought it best to

Sure. Well, there’s a ball game
tomorrow night, and Murph’s going
through a bit of a baseball phase.
There’ll be candy and soda ...
Ms Hanley looks at him, expectant.
I think I’ll take her to that.
Ms Hanley turns to the Principal, not happy.
I, uh ... got you suspended.
Sorry.
Cooper.
Power the controllers down for a
couple minutes.
Why?
Morse?
Murph, I know what Morse code is. I
just don’t think your bookshelf’s
trying to talk to you.
He leaves. Murph, embarrassed, turns back to the shelf.
Had to reset every compass clock
and GPS to offset for the anomaly.
No idea. If the house was built on
magnetic ore, we’d’ve seen this the
first time we switched on a
tractor.
Donald nods. Sips.
We’ve forgotten who we are, Donald.
Explorers, pioneers. Not
caretakers.
Donald nods, thoughtful. Weighs up his words.
We used to look up and wonder at
our place in the stars. Now we just
look down and worry about our place
in the dirt.
Well, in my day people were too
busy fighting over food for
baseball, so consider this
progress.
Murph offers Donald some popcorn.
The school says you’re gonna follow
in my footsteps. I think that’s
great.
What’s important is how you feel
about it, Tom.
Come on, guys.
Mask up, guys.
Murph and Tom take SURGICAL MASKS out of the glove box.
Did you both shut your windows?
Tom nods. Murph looks at Cooper. Runs for the stairs.
Wait INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Cooper gets to the doorway. Murph stands in the middle of
the room, STARING. Cooper SHUTS the window. The dust hangs
in the relative quiet. Murph is staring, TRANSFIXED, at
Grab your pillow, sleep in with
Tom.
It’s not a ghost ...
Cooper tosses the coin across a line. It SHOOTS at the floor
It’s gravity.

I got something.
Cooper is pointing to the thick and thin radial lines Binary. Thick is one, thin is zero
- it’s numbers ... number pairs...
He holds up the notebook to show Murph the number pairs.
Coordinates.
Grandpa’s back in two hours.

That’s why I can’t take you.
Murph?
Nothing.
Murph, just wait here for Grandpa.
Tell him I’ll call him on the
radio.
JESUS!
The truck WOBBLES as Cooper regains control.
Murph, what are you doing?!
Murph is LAUGHING as she climbs into the passenger seat COOPER
It’s not funny But Murph’s laugh is infectious.
Fair enough. Make yourself
useful...
The pickup cruises down the road, heading for the MOUNTAINS.

Murph. Murph.
Murph wakes.
I think this is as far as we get.
Murph glances out at the fence. Closes her eyes again.
I like your spirit, young lady.
Cooper gets out of the truck, retrieves his bolt-cutters and
comes up to the fence. He looks up and down the road.
Nothing. He reaches out and puts the jaws of the cutters WHAM! SPOTLIGHTS IN COOPER’S EYES - A HARSH ELECTRIC VOICE VOICE
Don’t shoot! My child is in the
car! I’m unarmed! My daughter is Murph watches, terrified as, with a ZAP, Cooper DROPS. Murph
Where’s my daughter?
WHERE’S MY DAUGHTER?!
Cooper’s scream REVERBERATES. Cooper sizes up the machine.
You might think you’re still in the
Marines, but the Marines don’t
exist anymore, pal. I’ve got grunts
like you mowing my grass ...
The Machine RISES to its full height.
But you don’t look like a lawnmower
to me ... you, I’m gonna turn into
an overqualified vacuum cleaner FEMALE VOICE
No, you’re not.
Cooper turns to see a businesslike woman in her thirties.
You’re taking a risk using
ex-military for security. They’re
old, their control units are
unpredictable ...

Who are you?
I knew a Dr Brand once. But he was
a professor WOMAN
What makes you think I’m not?
And nowhere near as cute.
Dr Brand, I have no idea what this
mess is. I’m scared for my little
girl and I want her by my side.
Then I’ll tell you anything you
want to know. Okay?
Brand considers this. Turns to Tars.
It’s pretty clear you don’t want
visitors - why not let us back up
from your fence and be on our way?

Sure it is. I don’t know anything
about you or this place.
Professor Brand?
Stumbled across it. Looking for
salvage and I saw the fence WILLIAMS
You’re sitting in the world’s best
kept secret - you don’t stumble in.
And you certainly don’t stumble
out.
It’s hard to explain, but we
learned these coordinates from an
anomaly ...
I don’t want to term it
’supernatural’ ... but ...
Cooper is losing them. Williams leans forward. Serious.
After that last storm, it was a
pattern ... in dust ...
Look, I’m happy you’re excited
about gravity, but if you want more
answers from us I’m gonna need
assurances WILLIAMS
Assurances?
Cooper looks at Murph. Then covers Murph’s ears.
That we’re getting out of here ...
and not in the trunk of some car.
Brand laughs. Williams smiles. Cooper looks confused.

No. No, I don’t.
NASA?
I heard you got shut down for
refusing to drop bombs from the
stratosphere onto starving people.
Why secret?
But we’re growing more than ever PROFESSOR BRAND
Like the potatoes in Ireland, like
the wheat in the dust bowl, the
corn will die. Soon.
Brand enters with Murph. She shows her the greenhouses.
We’ll find a way, we always have.
Not just ours, but it is our home.
Tell me this is where you explain
how you’re going to save the world.

Rangers.
What happened to the other
vehicles?
Sounds cheerful.
He had to die in the first place.
You sent people out there looking
for a new home ...
Professor Brand nods.
There’s no planet in our solar
system that can support life ...
and it’d take them a thousand years
to reach the nearest star - that
doesn’t even qualify as futile ...
Where did you send them, Professor?
I barely left the stratosphere.
Without ever knowing. An hour ago,
you didn’t even know I was still
alive. And you were going anyway.
Who’s ’they’?
Professor Brand is silent. Cooper wrestles.
How long would I be gone?
I’ve got my kids, Professor.
Who’s ’they’?
Over the Straights - my crash something tripped my fly-by wire ROMILLY
Exactly. But the most significant
anomaly was this ...
Cooper stares at an image of Saturn and its moons. Romilly
zooms in on some stars DISTORTED like ripples in a pond.
A wormhole?
Where does it lead?
A wormhole isn’t a naturally
occurring phenomenon.
’They’.
You sent probes into it?

The Lazarus missions.
Professor Brand rises and moves to a MEMORIAL, pointing PROFESSOR BRAND
Twelve possible worlds. Twelve
Ranger launches carrying the
bravest humans ever to live, led by
the remarkable Dr Mann.
And if their world didn’t show
promise?
Because you don’t have resources to
visit all twelve.
One? Kind of a long shot.
So if we find a new home, what
then?
This whole facility ... it’s a
vehicle? A space station?
How does it get off the Earth?
But you haven’t solved it, yet.
How could you raise them?
We just give up on the people here?
Where have you got to?
Almost? You’re asking me to hang
everything on an ’almost’?
Professor Brand moves close to Cooper.
All those years of training - you
never told me.
Murph?
I’m not gonna lie to you, Donald heading out there is what I feel
born to do and it excites me. That
doesn’t make it wrong.
Donald considers this. Turns to Cooper.

Well, the foundation’s solid.
We farmers sit here every year when
the rains fail and say ’next year’.
Next year ain’t gonna save us. Nor
the one after. This world’s a
treasure, Donald. But she’s been
telling us to leave for a while
now.
Mankind was born on Earth. It was
never meant to die here.
Donald considers this. Scoops the dust off the rail.
I will.
You have to talk to me.
Nothing.
I have to fix this before I go.
Murph turns, tear-stained, angry cheeks blazing -

After you kids came along, your
mother said something I didn’t
really understand - she said, ’I
look at the babies and I see myself
as they’ll remember me.’ She said,
’It’s as if we don’t exist anymore,
like we’re ghosts, like now we’re
just there to be memories for our
kids.’ Now I realize - once we’re
parents, we’re just the ghosts of
our childrens’ futures.
That’s right. I can’t be your ghost
right now - I need to exist.
Because they chose me. They chose
me, Murph. You saw it. Murph sits
up.
Points at the shelves. The gaps.
Murph MURPH
One word. You know what it is?
Cooper shakes his head sadly. Murph holds out her notebook ’STAY’. It says ’STAY’, Dad.
Oh, Murph.
It’s okay, it’s okay ...
Murph buries her head on Cooper’s shoulder, sobbing.
Murph, a father looks in his
child’s eyes and thinks - maybe
it’s them ... maybe my child will
save the world. And everyone, once
a child, wants to look into their
own dad’s eyes and know he saw how
they saved some little corner of
their world. But, usually, by then,
the father is gone.
No. I’m coming back.
One for you. One for me.
Murph takes the watch, curious. Cooper holds up his watch.
When I’m in hyper-sleep, or travel
near the speed of light, or near a
black hole, time will change for
me. It’ll run more slowly. When I
get back we’ll compare.
Yup. By the time I get back we
might even be the same age. You and
me. Imagine that ...
Murph takes this in. Cooper sees he’s made a mistake.
Wait, Murph MURPH
You have no idea when you’re coming
back.
Cooper looks at his daughter.

Don’t make me leave like this.
Nothing.
Please. I have to go now.
Murph will not turn around. Cooper tries to rest his hand on
the back of her head, but she shakes it off.
I love you, Murph. Forever. And I’m
coming back.
Cooper walks slowly out. A BOOK DROPS FROM THE SHELF. Cooper
turns to look at it. Then leaves.
Fine. It was fine.
Cooper turns to Tom. Hugs him. Tight enough for both kids.
I love you, Tom.
Look after our place, you hear?
I’ll make sure they bring it back
for you.
Cooper gets in. Starts the engine.
Mind my kids for me, Donald.

Donald nods. Cooper pulls out.
A massive, sarcastic robot. What a
great idea.

Probably help.
What’s your humor setting, Tars?
Take it to seventy-five, please.
We’ll get back.
She stares at the land. The oceans.
It’s hard. Leaving everything. My
kids ... your father ...
We should learn to talk.

Maybe you don’t need to be that
honest.
Tars, what’s your honesty
parameter?
Tars DISENGAGES from the floor and MOVES to the rear airlock
Ninety? What kind of robot are you?
Ninety percent honesty it is, then.
Brand looks at Cooper. Can’t help smiling.
Talking fine. Ready to spin?
Keep an eye on my family, sir.
Specially Murph. She’s a smart one.
So alone.
I meant them. Look at that perfect
planet. We’re not gonna find
another one like her.
Who’s Edmunds?
None of them had family?
Tell me about Dr Mann.
Brand replaces the screen image for a grainy, white orb.
Nature can’t be evil?
Just what we bring with us, then.
Even me?
Brand looks at him. Smiles.

Hey, I’ve been waiting a long time
to be up here BRAND
You are literally wasting your
breath.
Cooper nods at her. Joins Tars.
Show me the trajectory again.
Tars? Was Dr Brand TARS
Why are you whispering? You can’t
wake them.
Were Dr Brand and Edmunds ...
close?
Is that ninety percent, or ten
percent ’wouldn’t know’?
So I gather ...

The Earth looks amazing from here
... you can’t see any of the dust EXT. CORNFIELDS - DAY
A line of dust slides across the shimmering horizon.
Hope you guys are doing great. This
should get to you okay ...
Professor Brand said he’d make sure
of it. Guess I’ll say good night.
Donald recognizes Cooper’s truck ... Murph BURSTS out of the
house MURPH
Is it him?
You good, Rom?
Romilly looks at Cooper.
We’re explorers, Rom, on the
greatest ocean of all.
Romilly bangs on the side of the ship.
A lot of the finest solo yachtsmen
couldn’t swim. They knew if they
went overboard that was it, anyway.
This is no different.
Romilly considers this. Cooper passes him his ear buds COOPER
Here And the sounds of a THUNDERSTORM wash over Romilly, sounds
that take us to ...
From the relay probe?
Like swinging a periscope around?
So we’ve got a pretty good idea
what we’re gonna find on the other
side?
Strap in - I’m killing the spin ...
Say it, don’t spray it, Rom.
It’s a sphere.
No ... well, in all the
illustrations Romilly grabs a piece of paper, draws two points, far apart
A sphere.
I’m not thanking anyone till we get
through it in one piece.
Any trick to this?
But the others made it, right?
Thanks for the confidence boost.
Cooper stares down into the vast lens of the wormhole.
Everybody ready to say goodbye to
our solar system?
Gargantua?
Look, I can swing around that
neutron star to decelerate BRAND
It’s not that, it’s time. That
gravity will slow our clock
compared to Earth’s. Drastically.
How bad?
Jesus ROMILLY
That’s relativity, folks.
We can’t drop down there without
considering the consequences.
That’s easy for you to say - you
don’t have anyone back on Earth
waiting for you, do you?
How far off the planet do we have
to stay to be out of the time
shift?
Romilly indicates a spot on his white board.
So we track a wider orbit of
Gargantua, parallel with Miller’s
planet but a little further out ...
take a Ranger down, grab Miller and
her samples, debrief and analyze
back here
No time for monkey business down
there - Tars, you’d better wait up
here. Who else?
Okay. Tars, factor an orbit of
Gargantua - minimal thrusting conserve fuel - but stay in range.
Ready?
Don’t say much, do you?
Detach EXT. ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
The Ranger DETACHES from the ring module, like an X-1 from a
B-29, FIRES retro-thrusters to slow and ... DROPS EXT. THE BLACK HOLE, GARGANTUA - DAY
The Ranger SHOOTS down towards Gargantua -

Romilly, you reading these forces?
No way to get anything from it?
We’re gonna use the Ranger’s
aerodynamics to save the fuel.
Wanna get in fast, don’t we?
Hands where I can see them, Case!
Only time I ever went down was a
machine easing at the wrong moment
Can get you killed, same as
reckless.
I got this.
Cooper squeezes the shaking controls with white knuckles CASE
Should I disable the feedback?

No! No, I need to feel the air ...
Do we have a fix on the beacon?
Gotta shave more speed. I’ll try
and spiral down on it Doyle looks at Brand, nervous. She takes a breath.
Wait for it ...
Fire!
No. But it was very efficient.
What’re you waiting for? Go!
Brand and Doyle hurry out of their harnesses, helmets on.
Case moves to the hatch. With a CRACK, the hatch opens and
Come on ...
Those aren’t mountains ...
They’re waves Brand looks closer - the ’mountains’ are moving, tiny lines
of white sea spray are blowing from the tops ...
Brand, get back here!
Dammit! Brand, get back here!
You don’t have time!
Case is back at Doyle.
Get back here! Now!
Brand has pulled something heavy from the wreckage - she
Get up, Brand!
Doyle! Come on! Case has her!
Doyle turns, starts sloshing back, the water RUNNING against
his ankles now ... Two hundred yards behind, Case POUNDS
through the shallows, Brand on his back Cooper looks up at the EVER CLOSER MOUNTAIN WAVE - jumps
inside.
Come on, come on ...
He sees the water right upon them - RUNS back to the hatch.
Doyle is at the foot of the ladder, Case RUNNING FAST.
Shut the hatch!
Case shuts the hatch. Cooper is throwing switches -

Power down! Power down! We have to
ride it out!
We are not prepared for this!
And I told you to get your ass back
here! Difference is, only one of us
was thinking about the mission BRAND
Cooper, you were thinking about
getting home - I was trying to do
the right thing!
Tell that to Doyle.
Quiet. Cooper looks down at the clock. Bitter.
How long to drain, Case?
The stuff of life, huh? What’s this
gonna cost us, Brand?
What happened to Miller?
How could the wreckage still be
together after all these years?
We’re not prepared for this, Brand.
You’re a bunch of eggheads without
the survival skills of a boy-scout
troop.
Not far enough. And we’re stuck
here till there won’t be anyone
left on Earth to save BRAND
I’m counting every second, same as
you, Cooper.
Cooper takes this in. They’re in the same boat.
Don’t you have some clever way we
jump into a black hole and get back
the years?

She shakes her head, dismissive.
Don’t just shake your head at me -!
The beings who led us here ... they
communicate through gravity ...
Brand nods.
Could they be talking to us from
the future?
Well, if they can BRAND
Look, Cooper, they’re creatures of
at least five dimensions - to them
time may be just another physical
dimension. To them the past might
be a canyon they can climb into and
the future a mountain they can can
climb up ... but to us it’s not,
okay?
Brand pulls her helmet off. Looks Cooper in the eyes.
My daughter was ten. I couldn’t
explain Einstein’s theories before
I left.
No. I wasn’t much of a parent, but
I understood the most important
thing - let your kids feel safe.
Which rules out telling a
ten-year-old that the world’s
ending.
How long for the engines?
We don’t have it!
The mountain wave is approaching. Cooper tries the engines EXT. RANGER - CONTINUOUS
The rockets COUGH and steam ...
Helmets on!
The wave is upon them ...
Blow our cabin oxygen through the
main thrusters. We’ll spark it Case hits a button - a HISS and SHRIEK of gas escaping ...
Brand seals her helmet just as the cockpit DEPRESSURIZES COOPER
Come on, now ...
Cooper hits the engines - they BLAST TO LIFE -

How many years?
Cooper.
I know.
Just start at the beginning.
Cooper leans forward as the screen flickers to life: Tom,
still seventeen, turns on the camera.
Murph?
Tars kept the Endurance right where
we needed her, but it took years
longer than we anticipated ...
Cooper puts both planets on screen - Dr Mann’s ice world,
and Edmunds’ desert planet.
We don’t have the fuel to visit
both prospects. We have to choose.
As does Dr Mann’s.
Why?

You once referred to Dr Mann as the
’best of us’.
And he’s there on the ground
sending an unambiguous message that
we should go to that planet.
Brand is silent. Romilly looks from Brand to Cooper.
If we’re going to vote, there’s
something you need to know. Brand?
She says nothing.
He has a right to know.
She’s in love with Wolf Edmunds.
You’re a scientist, Brand BRAND
I am. So listen to me when I tell
you that love isn’t something we
invented - it’s observable,
powerful. Why shouldn’t it mean
something?
It means social utility - child
rearing, social bonding BRAND
We love people who’ve died ...
where’s the social utility in that?
Maybe it means more - something we
can’t understand, yet. Maybe it’s
some evidence, some artifact of
higher dimensions that we can’t
consciously perceive. I’m drawn
across the universe to someone I
haven’t seen for a decade, who I
know is probably dead. Love is the
one thing we’re capable of
perceiving that transcends
dimensions of time and space. Maybe
we should trust that, even if we
can’t yet understand it.
Brand looks at Romilly, who can’t meet her eye.
Honestly, Amelia ... it might.
Romilly looks at Brand. It’s clear she’s lost.
Tars, set the course for Dr Mann.
Brand is starting to tear up. She turns away.
Brand, I’m sorry.
This wasn’t a personal decision for
me.
Brand turns from her equipment. Looks him in the eye.
It’s okay. It’s okay.
Lazarus.
With our situation, there’s not
much hope of any other rescue.
This hits Dr Mann hard. He looks down at his tea.
How far have you explored?
He never even hoped to get people
off the Earth.
More what?!
Is that true?
If we could look beyond the horizon
Bullshit.
No. That’s being made by the people
of Earth who’ll die because, in his
arrogance, he declared their case
hopeless.
Let me go home.

They can stay. I’ll sleep most of
the journey.

What?

You’d do this for us?
Your cue light’s broken.
Ranger’s almost ready. Case is on
his way back down with another
load.
We need to pick out a site. You
don’t wanna move the module once we
land it.
Will conditions hold?
Good to go.
Dr Mann points at a nozzle on his elbow DR MANN
Charged?
Cooper checks, thumbs up. Dr Mann sets off, Cooper follows.
A little caution, Case?
If this excursion is about trying
to change my mind, let’s turn
around right now.
Frankly, no.
That’s why I’m going home, hopeless
or not.
Professor Brand would disagree.
Cooper peers over the edge at an enormous CREVASSE ...
Dr Mann RIPS COOPER’S LONG-RANGE TRANSMITTER FROM HIS NECK -

Cooper TURNS to Dr Mann - who BLASTS him with his ELBOW JET.
He SLIPS backwards, but avoids going over the edge COOPER

In SILENCE Dr Mann looks through the hatch window. Hits the
button opening the outer door EXT. ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
The outer door of the Ranger SLIDES OPEN. Several grapples
are OPENING AND CLOSING BLINDLY, trying to seal the join -

What happens if he blows the hatch?
Pull us back!
Case hits the retro-thrusters.
Just analyze the Endurance’s spin BRAND
What’re you doing?!

Docking.
Get ready to match it on the
retro-thrusters CASE
It’s not possible COOPER
No. It’s necessary.
Case, you ready?
If I black out, take the stick Tars, get ready to engage the
docking mechanism - Brand, hold
tight CASE
Endurance is starting to heat COOPER
Come on, Tars ... come on ...
Gen-- gentle, Case ...
Get ready to pull us up The spin is slowing to almost nothing -

Come on. You can do it ...
Right? And for our next trick ...
Take her INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - MOMENTS LATER
No! Let her slide as long as we can
Cooper FLIES over to Tars, who is welding a bulkhead COOPER
Give it to me.
I’ve heard that one, Tars - just
give it to me straight.
The navigation mainframe’s
destroyed and we don’t have enough
life support to make it back to
Earth. But we might scrape to
Edmunds’ planet.
Not enough. But I’ve got a plan let Gargantua suck us right to her
horizon - then a powered slingshot
around to launch us at Edmunds.
That’s what I’m here for. I’ll take
us just inside the critical orbit.
Neither of us can afford to worry
about relativity right now.

Once we’ve gathered enough speed
around Gargantua - we use the
lander 1 Ranger 2 as
rocket-boosters to push us out of
the black hole’s gravity ...
The lander REATTACHES to the rear of the ring module.
The linkages between landers are
destroyed ...
So we’ll control manually. When
Lander 1’s spent, Tars will detach
...

We have to shed mass if we’re gonna
escape that gravity.
He’s a robot, Amelia - I don’t have
to ask him to do anything.
Sorry, you broke up a little there.
Ready.
Fire.
That little maneuver cost us
fifty-one years ...!
Hey, Case? Nice reckless flying.
Newton’s third law - you have to
leave something behind.

Hey, we agreed - ninety percent.
Detach EXT. ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
Ranger 2 DROPS AWAY from the Endurance ...
Tars? Are you there?
Murph? Murph?
She can’t hear him ...
MURPH! MURPH!
She turns ... leaves the room ... Cooper floats there,
staring. He LOOKS around - each ’wall’ of the tesseract is a
different view of Murph’s bedroom, so that by rotating he
can effectively orbit her room ...
He claws his way down to the next book wall. PUNCHES out two
books Murph’s bedroom, empty. The door opens, Cooper’s EARLIER
Don’t go, you idiot!
His Earlier Self shuts the door ...
Don’t leave your kids. You goddamn
fool.
Cooper PUNCHES OUT books with all his strength COOPER
S ... T ...
Murph  is watching, no longer scared, fascinated COOPER
A ... Y ...
Cooper STOPS. Catches his breath. Waits ...
Earlier Cooper lifts the chair off the table to enter.
Cooper watches his earlier self, FRUSTRATED COOPER
Stay, you idiot! Tell him, Murph!
Stay ...
As before, Cooper gives Murph the WATCH ... Murph THROWS THE
Murph, tell him again! Don’t let
him leave ...!
Murph, don’t let me leave ...
Cooper watches as his earlier self heads to the door COOPER
You survived.
Who’s ’They’? And why would they
help us?

It isn’t working -!
Gravity. To send a message ...
Cooper looks around the infinite tunnel, infinite Coopers.
Gravity crosses the dimensions including time Cooper THINKS ... He pulls himself up to a different wall,
starts counting books ...
And you have the quantum data, now
I can do it Cooper HITS a book’s world line, sending a WAVE ...
Not just any child.

Then figure something out!
Everybody on Earth is going to die!
We brought ourselves here ...
Cooper PUSHES off, looking through the gaps in the books.
Murph’s bedroom, full of DUST in the DUST STORM COOPER
Tars, feed me the coordinates of
Don’t you see, Tars? I brought
myself here. We’re here to
communicate with the
three-dimensional world. We’re the
bridge ...
Cooper moves to another iteration of Murph’s room. Murph
JUMPS up - GRABS the WATCH, RUNS out the door ...
I thought they chose me - they
never chose me - they chose Murph.
To save the world!
Murph  comes back into her bedroom, SOBBING. She is
holding the watch. She puts it on the shelf.

’They’ have access to infinite
time, infinite space ...
Cooper gestures at the INFINITIES in all directions ...
But no way to find what they need but I can find Murph and find a way
to tell her - like I found this
moment TARS
How?
Love, Tars. Love - just like Brand
said - that’s how we find things
here.
The watch. That’s it. She’ll come
back for it TARS
How do you know?
Because I gave it to her. We use
the second hand. Translate the data
into Morse and feed it to me Tars starts to transmit. Cooper GRABS the second-hand world
line - starts to MANIPULATE it, sending waves down the world
line ...

She will. She will ... I feel it
...
The second hand is FLICKING back and forth ...
Did it work?
Why?
Don’t you get it, yet, Tars? ’They’
aren’t ’beings’ ... they’re us ...
trying to help ... just like I
tried to help Murph ...
Not yet ... but one day. Not you
and me but people, people who’ve
evolved beyond the four dimensions
we know ...
The tesseract EXPANSION BACK INTO FIVE DIMENSIONS IS ALMOST
What happens now -?
Where am I?
The Doctor, almost surprised, TURNS, moves to the window,
opens the curtains. Where Cooper should see sky, he sees a
Nice of you to name the place after
me.
The Nurse giggles. The Doctor shoots her a look -

What?
Is she ...
still alive?
Yes, it is ...
The Doctor is wrapping up DOCTOR
We’ll have you checked out in a
couple days.
Cooper turns back to the window, thinking ...
She did, huh?
Cooper looks over the kitchen. Cooper sees a
familiar-looking articulated machine -

Is that ...?
Please.
Honesty. New level setting.
Ninety-five percent.
Yes. Humor, seventy-five percent.
Wait.
Sixty percent.
Is she -?

The family?
Murph.
You told them I like farming.
Murph smiles, still mischievous. Cooper marvels at her.
Murph, it was me. I was your ghost.
A father looks in his child’s eyes
and thinks - maybe it’s them maybe my child will save the world.
How?
I’m here now. I’m here for you,
Murph.
Murph is shaking her head.
Where?
