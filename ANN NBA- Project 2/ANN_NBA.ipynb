For this to happen we decided to take the players with the top 5 average minutes played in the season as they were likely the starting players for that team during that season. In order to do this, we had to engineer a new feature called average minutes played which would be the basis for our roster selections. \n",

It calculates the percentage of predictions that fall within 5 and 10 games of the actual win rate, showing how close the model’s predictions are to reality. Specifically, 39.3% of the predictions were within 5 games, and 60.7% were within 10 games. Additionally, common regression metrics are calculated: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R²). The MAE of 0.10 reflects an average prediction error of about 8.2 games, the MSE of 0.02 captures overall error magnitude, and the R² of 0.26 indicates that the model explains 26% of the variance in win rates. These results highlight that while the model provides reasonable predictions, there is still significant room for improvement in accuracy and explanatory power.\n",
